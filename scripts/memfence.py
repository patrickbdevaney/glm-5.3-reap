"""Per-step memory admission control, inside the process, before each allocation.

WHY THIS AND NOT THE THINGS WE ALREADY HAVE. Four box resets on 2026-09-26/27 established
that every external control fails on this hardware:

  * `drop_caches` cannot reclaim a live allocation, and on Tegra NvMap cannot reclaim
    page-cached pages the way MemAvailable implies -- a small allocation can fail with GiB
    "available" (vllm-project/vllm#35920, jarida-io/goose-in-a-pond#370).
  * SIGKILL does not land on a process blocked in the GPU driver. memguard killed the correct
    PID twice, 39 s apart, and MemAvailable fell 125MB -> 97MB -> 49MB regardless.
  * cgroup `MemoryMax` does not bind Tegra unified allocations; they are not charged to the
    cgroup that requested them.

If nothing outside the process can stop it, the process has to stop itself. `require()` is
called BEFORE each large allocation with that allocation's predicted size. It reads live
MemAvailable and raises rather than allocating. An exception unwinds Python and frees tensors;
a wedged box does not.

This is deliberately a RUNTIME check, not the static model in mem_lookahead.py. The static model
bounds the configuration before launch; this bounds each step during it. MEASURED: the static
model was right about S=16384-eager and still missed the S=16384-sparse failure, because peak
depends on driver-pool state that no static model can see.
